Create a new project with cargo:
```bash
cargo new hello_cargo
```

Compile:
```bash
cargo build
```

Compile and run:
```bash
cargo run
```

Verify it is compiling but doesn't produce an executable (faster than `cargo build`):
```bash
```bash
cargo check
```

Build a release (compile with optimizations):
```bash
cargo build --release
```
